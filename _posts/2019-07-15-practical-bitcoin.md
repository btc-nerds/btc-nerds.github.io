I'll try to order this content as a user might progress naturally through the Bitcoin software ecosystem.

1. Onramps
2. Wallets
3. P2P BTC
4. Nodes
  * mining
5. Layer 1 Apps
  * musig \ escrow
6. Lightning
  * Lightning Apps
7. Pi
8. Sattelite

For the purposes of the Bitcoin Takeover iteration, I don't expect I'll stray into exchanges or mining, simply for the reduced complexity. 

I plan to keep my commentary as brief as possible, and add guides where they will provide the most value.
