Hi, I'm Infominer! I'm a computer nerd, avid reader from way back, and internet research enthusiast. I don't consider myself a good writer. However, I love to read, and when I do write, I spend a lot of time editing. I care about reliable sources, love the research, and have an attention for detail.

I'll intertwine some bitcoin history, along with a bit of my own story, and how I came to Bitcoin. Then, I'll share some practical tools and guides to make it easier for anyone to use Bitcoin.

## A Seeker of Truth

Growing up, I spent a lotta time at libraries, before the internet took off.. and ever since, searched for the truth wherever I thought it may be found. 

I was also a computer geek, from a young age. I never got serious about it, but I've always loved figuring out how to accomplish various tasks using a keyboard, mouse, screen, and some ingenuity. 

I remember using search when the web was young, in the mid-late '90s. I would debate various topics in the newsgroups. There were a number of search engines, I probably used them all to some extent. It was a little crude back then... but I was persistant, and creative with my search terms. 

As a young adult, I chose to disengage from "the system" and associated with the US Dollar, as little as possible. 

However, that led me down a path of indolence, and the creative outlets I found were never as compelling to me as computers. I clearly should have just gotten serious about tech, from a young age.

## From hearing about Bitcoin, to becoming a Bitcoiner

Somewhere between 2013-15, A friend told me their hard-drive was encrypted and there was a Bitcoin ransom for it. While I had been out of tech for a while, it was hard to believe in some attack that I would be powerless to repair. Gone are the days of trivial virus infections. Click the wrong link, run the wrong app.. get yer hardrive encrypted!! yowza!

A year or so later, I heard a story about a guy that was gonna help my buddy buy drugs on the darknet, "with untracable digital currency," who instead ran off with their funds.

I really began paying attention when I decided to start a new life, after years of booze and drug abuse. I decided to get into writing. Reallly, I just like reading a lot, and it's been something like therapy for me.

When I first began, my mind was so addled that I could barely focus on the screen. All the same, I looked for opportunities to practice the craft, and earn as a writer. In the summer of 2017, I stumbled upon a social media site that let me earn crypto as a content creator. That's when I began to learn a little of what Bitcoin is really about.

After the market crashed, I ditched the shitcoin and went into freelance. Like most people starting without any web-work experience, I landed at a bottom of the barrel freelance site, for dirt cheap rates.

## Systematic and Iterative

I do a lot more research than required for any given assignment. In part, this is a habit from coming into the scene fresh, and having to do so much backgroudn reading in order to write (and properly reference) the advance topics I promoted services in. 

Being in such a new and emerging space, I'm still very much in the discovery phase, and only beginning to develop strong positions. I mostly stick with gathering and relating information.

Throughout 2017, everyone was bashing Bitcoin, saying how it was like the Model T, and trying to pitch their alternative. So, not being very educated, it was easy to think the same.

Once I began a serious study of Bitcoin, [in early 2018](https://www.csbtechemporium.com/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency/), I was drawn to its simplicity, and immediately identified with its cypherpunk roots. I knew that if I wanted to know anything about cryptocurrency, I needed to learn a lot more about Bitcoin.

I also realized that, finally(!!!), there is some possibility for me to earn a living divorced from central bankers and thier schemes. I decided to try and sort through and categorize the dense sea of information surrounding Bitcoin, making it easier to navigate. It's a huge problem, challenging, rewarding, and I'm learning lots of ways to be a valuable participant of the internet.

## Not Just Bitcoin History

I want to understand all what led into Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin is somewhat complicated, I decided to go back and study the history of [classical cryptography](https://www.axiomtech.io/blog-feed/pre-digital-cryptography-a-history), in hopes that it would help me understand modern cryptography. 

Throughout recorded history, the art of encryption was a highly secretive practice. The earliest known forms begin with simple substitutions, where the alphabet is paired with a corresponding key, which is used to both encode and decrypt the message.

The most secure form of cryptography is a one-time pad. This is a system where each key is used only once, and never again. However, the oldest problem in cryptography is key-distribution. Regardless of how weak or secure the encryption method, how are we to manage the creation and distribution of our keys to exchange with the intended recipient?

Perhaps, the most democratizing technology ever invented is Public Key Cryptography. Public key encryption changed everything, by splitting a key into two parts. One that may be publicly available and visible to all, and the other is kept privately, known only to its owner. 

**Using your public key, I can encrypt a message that only you can open.**

That technology introduced a shift in the balance of power, so great, it's no wonder that powerful governments resisted its proliferation.

For a time, there was a threat that public key encryption would be outlawed altogether. Because of that threat, Phil Zimmerman released PGP to the world for free, in 1991. This was first time in recorded history that strong encryption became available to the general public. Immediately, it came into use by individuals under oppresive regimes, where the ability to communicate privately was a matter of life and death.

The internet had begun to emerge around this time, and soon the world began working towards, digital currency, and digital payments. While there were many attempts at both, digital payments were solved by the end of the decade, and the quest for electronic currency retreated from the stage.

**I have this habit where I think about nearly everything in relation to Bitcoin.**

Above conveys but a sliver of the history leading to the creation and proliferation of Bitcoin. I'm also interested in the quest for artificial intelligence that spans the course of computing history; open source, which has roots in an AI reserach lab; P2P starting around the birth of the internet, law, economics, game theory, world politics...

## The Quest for Decentralized Identity

I started working seriously on the topic of Decentralized Identity back in September 2018. After a few gigs writing on the subject, I had gathered enough links to start building an "Awesome List" on GitHub... and down another rabbithole.

Like almost everything related to digital cryptography, the pursuit of decentralized identity can be traced back as far back as David Chaum's 1985, *Security without Identification [Transactions Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete](https://www.chaum.com/publications/Security_Wthout_Identification.html)*. 

Chaum invented mix networks, anonymous digital messaging, digital cash, and essentially pioneered the field of digital cryptography. He also happened to have described a system for Self Sovereign Identity, decades before the term and underlying concepts arose through a collaborative community process.

May 2000, Planetworks Conference was the first international summit on Global Ecology and Information Technology. Held annually, in San Francisco, through 2004, this series of events, and the communities that arose around them  collectively embarked upon the modern movement towards Sovereign Identity. 

  >Planetwork convened the first international conference on global ecology and information technology in May 2000, beginning a conversation about creating a distributed online social network to empower individuals and civil society, and publishing the [ASN Whitepaper](http://asn.planetwork.net) in 2003.

From 2004-2005, Architect of Identity, Microsoft Corporation, Kim Cameron, wrote [The Laws of Identity](https://www.identityblog.com/?paged=4&m=2004), in a collaborative fashion through a network of blogs who worked out these topics, together.  

Since those early days, a number of communities have grown around the idea of creating systems for identification, that are sufficient at every level of security assurance, that require the least amount of disclosure possible for the needs of each engagement. Having control over our identifiers is emerging as a fundamental human right, and its proven that data silos make attractive honey pots, impossible to secure. 

## Enter Bitcoin... and Microsoft?

Thanks to Daniel Buchner, Microsoft is helping to build a toolkit for using the Bitcoin blockchain in conjunction with the [W3C DID specification](https://w3c-ccg.github.io/did-spec/), so that Bitcoin can be used for securing decentralized identifiers. Those identifiears are to be as widely useful and as interoperable as possible with every other platform in the world. That's the goal, anyways. Heavy stuff.

So, I finally gathered together enough history, domain knowledge, that it's getting easier for me to understand Bitcoin, and it's complex web of relationships and codebases. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is gaining dominance, every day and I'm compelled to focus *a lot* more on Bitcoin, sooner than later.

So it was awesome when Vlad Costea asked me about writing a chapter for this book, and it was a perfect excuse to slot some weeks in my schedule for Bitcoin, only. 

## Bitcoin: Tools, Apps, Libraries, HowTos

When deciding which content would be most useful for the community, realized it would be great to have a serious collection of practical tools and guides for using Bitcoin.

I started by sorting through whatever I'd collected over the past year. From there, I began scouring lopp.net, bitcoin.org, Bitcoin Only, LNRoute.. I clicking through through those sites, "one link at a time", and sorted them in an iterative process, deciding upon categories as I go. Then I got into the Awesome lists, and started feeling like I had surveyed a broad swath of the Bitcoin information ecosystem. Next, I dove face first into the [Bitcoin Topic on Github](https://github.com/topics/bitcoin). 

As far as finding practical applcations interacting with Bitcoin in some way, it's hard to find a more comprehensive source than that. I'm still not through the entire list.

I won't be able to list all of the practical Bitcoin links I've found here, but this should be a good start. I'll leave notes regarding any software I've used.

## You MUST Do Your Own Research

This is intended to be a starting point for anyone who is interested in using Bitcoin code \ hardware. These guides and tutorials are a great jumping off point, from which you can explore a variety of technologies you may not even have known were available.

Please. Do your own research.

There may be newer materials or advisaries for any of the following projects. Be sure to have a look around for additional information, rather than relying entirely upon this "hastily crafted" essay.
