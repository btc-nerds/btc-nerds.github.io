Hi, I'm Infominer! I don't consider myself a good writer. However, I spend a lot of time editing, care about reliable sources, have an attention for detail, and love the research.

## I've alway been a seeker of truth. 

That's my longest running life's goal. I've read a lot of books, spent a lotta time at libraries before the internet took off, and ever since searched for the truth wherever it could be found. 

It's no bother to learn deep truth, especially if it doesn't benefit you in some visceral fashion... because theres no real work in it, and it's not like you can go up to a buddy and say "hey, will you read these books.. oh yeah, and just these couple of essays, real quick? I really want you to watch this 4 hour youtube video with me, but it would be **way** better if you do some background reading first." 

Besides reading a ton, I was also a computer geek, from a young age. I never got serious about it, but I always love working with computers and figuring out how to accomplish various tasks with them. I remember using search when the web was young, in the mid-late '90s. We would debate topics in the newsgroups, with internet search as our trusty weapon. It was a little crude back then... but I knew that if I was persistant, methodical, and creative with my search terms, I could find the information I was looking for. 

As a young adult, I chose to disengage with a system that I find to be harmful to humanity, dedicated to lies and deceit, and associated with the US Dollar, as little as possible. I ate from the trash, and suffered much, socially. Although I had all the time in the world, free from the shackals of "The Man", I had to consistantly face the fact that you aren't allowed to simply exist anywhere, unless somone is paying off government officials with *Federal Reserve Debt Instruments*... that's what I've seen in the states, anyways.

If you really want to divorce yourself from the system, you need to be handy. If you are good with tools, fixing, tinkering, solving whatever problems your possessions present with some elbow-grease and ingenuity. Its also a huge benefit if you are both socially concious and verbally agile. Even then, it still really helps to have a bunch of (fiat) money, to get started and to persist in living... go figure! 

I didn't have the right combo for the path I took, and really what I was ignorant of is how if I wanted to divorce myself from the fiat rule, no better way than to learn everything about computers, and how to program them. Then the rulers are dependent on you and your ilk. But I was not so far sighted.. and pursued futile ends for quite some time.


### From hearing about Bitcoin, to Caring About It

Somewhere between 2013-15, A friend told me their hard-drive was encrypted and there was a cryptocurrency ransom for it. While I had been out of tech for a while, it was hard to believe in some attack that I would be powerless to repair. However, I could not dispute the power of cryptography. A year or so later, someone told me about how you could buy drugs on the darkweb, and someone told them how to do it, and proceeded to "helped them buy drugs" (run off with like $10k worth of Bitcoin).

**T**he tipping point where I came when I started at creating a new life, after "bucking the system" took me far off course, down a path of indolence. As a second chance, after a life of booze and drugs, I've been blessed with a room, board, and freedom to create my own independent curriculum, with the aim of becoming a productive, pro-social, *independent citizen* (that can pay for their own room\board and government extortion, I mean taxes). While I have fiat forms of identification, my goal has long been to be independent of centralized government involvement in my life. 

**I** decided to try about writing for a living. However, my mind wasn't working too well, and I could barely focus on the page, at the start. All the same, I looked for opportunities to earn as a writer, and practice the craft. In the summer of 2017, I stumbled upon a social media site that let me earn crypto as a content creator. 

**A**t first, I was a strong believer in that platform, but I "learned too much", and realized how big of a scam it was. In fact, their hobbyiest homeschool chainanalysis community were (quietly) threatened with violence, and told to stop digging around. So it made sense to distance myself from that project, rather than risk my own skin fighting a scam and giving it's devious systemm free exposure. Folk love a good scam, and flock in droves when you promote \ expose it.

From there, I got into freelance, and started with a bottom of the heap freelance site, for dirt cheap rates, and practiced research based content creation, developed a formatting style and gradually learned markdown, HTML, and other markup languages. Basically looking for anyone who would pay me to research (but, primarily, usually to write about) topics I find valuable to know about and within my interests.

## A Systematic and Iterative Process.

**I** undertake far more research than required for any given assignment. In part, this is a habit from coming into the scene fresh, and having to do so much research in order to write (and properly reference) the advance topics I promoted services in. Moreover, being in such a new and emerging space, I'm still very much in the discovery phase, and haven't much to offer in the way of a personal position. I try to stick with gathering and relating information.

**T**hrough 2017, I thought that Bitcoin was like the Model T, and someone would surely come along with a more robust implementation, eventually. Now, I'm not so sure about that. 

**O**nce I began a serious study of Bitcoin, [in early 2018](https://www.csbtechemporium.com/bitcoin-blockchain-cryptocurrency/), I realized how incredible it was for such a powerful force to be introduced with an 8 page whitepaper. While I couldn't understand all of it, anyone would find reading it valuable. From there, I knew that in order to understand anything about cryptocurrency, I must learn a lot more about Bitcoin. 

I also realized, that finally, there is a possibility for me to earn a living by studying and discovering the best information about Bitcoin and the crypto ecosystem. It's a huge problem, so that will satisfy my appetite to verify the integrity of information. It's also something I can feel wonderful about all the lives improved over decades to come, by making an early start at sorting through the information surrounding Bitcoin.

### Curation Can't Be Automated

Curation can't ever be fully automated, only facilitated. Information is growing faster than the algorithms can keep up with, and jobs are being automated left, right, and everywhich way. So I'm banking on the idea that if I'm dilligent, and provide value to the community, I can earn a living without rely on the federal reserve note. I'll even be excited if I ever earn enough to have an opportunity to file a tax report. Maybe I'll even see about paying my taxes in Bitcoin. Make them deal w the exchange!

## Not Just Bitcoin History

I need to understand all what led into Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin is complicated, enough, and then layer two, and all the other cryptosystems. I decided to go back and study the history of [classical cryptography](https://www.axiomtech.io/blog-feed/pre-digital-cryptography-a-history).

The Kama Sutra contains some of the earliest mentions of cryptography known to history.  The version of the Kama Sutra we have available was written in India, 4th century AD, based on manuscripts dating back to the 4th century BC. In 850AD, Al-Kindi, an Arab mathematician, published “Manuscript for the Deciphering Cryptographic Messages.” That document is the earliest written example of cryptanalytic (codebreaking) techniques, including a description of frequency analysis. That is the frequency in which a given letter typically occurs, proportionally to the length of a message.

Throughout recorded history, the art of encryption was a highly secretive practice. The advent of computers would gradually erode resistence to the proliferation of its knowledge. Perhaps the most democratizing technology ever invented is Public Key Cryptography. Its no wonder that governments who were aware of it had no interest in its proliferation. Part of the reason why the practice and knowledge of cryptography has been so secretive, is because those secrets were kept secure only if their method of encryption remained unknown.

Public key encryption changed everything, by splitting a key into two parts. One that may be publicly available, and the other kept secret and known only to its owner. With a public key algorithm, as long as I'm sure I know your real public key, I can use that information to encrypt a message that only you can open.

That technology introduced a shifting the balance of power, so great, it's no wonder that powerful governments resisted its proliferation. Keeping that first mover status as long as possible granted those powers a strategic advantage over anyone without its knowledge.

For a time, there was a threat that public key encryption would be outlawed altogether. Because of that threat, Phil Zimmerman released PGP to the world for free, in 1991. This marked first time in recorded history that strong encryption became widely available to the general public. Immediately it came into use by individuals under oppresive regimes, where the ability to communicate privately was a matter of life and death.

The internet had also begun to emerge around this time, and the world began wondering about, and working towards, digital currency, and digital payments. While there were many attempts at both, payments were solved by the end of the decade, and the quest for electronic currency languished while internet commerce took center stage during the advent of a new Milleneum.

**I have this habit where I think about nearly everything in relation to Bitcoin.**

Above conveys but a sliver of the history leading into the creation and spread of Bitcoin. The history of money, itself, could also be considered, along with manipulation of the precious metals market (and its valuations) stretching back throughout all recorded history. 

The History of AI, which runs parallel to and is interwoven with the entirety of computing history... history of Open Source (which, incidentally, has roots in an AI reserach lab), p2p (which begins in pararallel with the invention of the internet), law, economics, object capabilities, game theory, blockchain and the united nations... and too few clients who are actually seeking content on these subjects.

## Content Creation

I've studied and created content around a number of topics. Among the most highly developed, is the pursuit of Decentralized Identity, and its history. Like a lot of things in crypto, it can be traced back directly, at least as far back as David Chaum's 1985, *Security without Identification [Transactions Systems to Make Big Brother Obsolete](https://www.chaum.com/publications/Security_Wthout_Identification.html)*. That's right, not only did Chaum invented anonymous electronic messaging and digital cash, he also happened to have described a system for Self Sovereign Identity decades before the term was invented, through a process of community collaboration making no reference to Chaum's early thoughts on identity.

I started working seriously on the topic of Decentralized Identity back in September 2018, because I had written a number of articles on the subject, freelance. I found that Indy was the only *really* interesting Hyperledger product (at that time), and that they were trying to do the same thing for identity, that Bitcoin has done for currency. 

In fact, that's just one aspect of a network spanning the globe who are all working generally towards the goals of Sovereign Identity, with various ideas and systems for doing so. 

May 2000, in San Francisco, the Planetworks Conference was the first international summit on Global Ecology and Information Technology. Held annually, through 2004, this series of events, and the communities that arose around them (h/t [@identitywoman](https://twitter.com/identitywoman)) collectively embarked upon the modern movement towards Sovereign Identity. developed through it were some of the earliest efforts towards computing systems designed for the needs of humans, rather than purely profit driven corporate and monopolistic motives, as has been the status quo, since when.

From 2004-2005, Kim Cameron, Architect of Identity, Microsoft Corporation wrote [The Laws of Identity](https://www.identityblog.com/?paged=4&m=2004), as a collaborative process through a network of blogs who worked out these topics, together. Self Sovereign Identity gradually arose from thought and efforts across the globe with the aim of creating a global decentralized network for identification. A network for people, where individuals have primary control over their identifiers, the storage of related metadata, and full control over how that information is shared. 

The intent of these systems is to require the least amount of disclosure possible for the needs of each engagement, and that the user should have full control over the creation and use of their identifier. Proposed methods include using a different identifier for each relationship, so that third parties aren't able to collude and create a profile of you with their combined data. This is the same kind of stuff Chaum was talking about in the 80's, but it's easier said than done.

### Enter Bitcoin... and Microsoft?

Most people (outside the identerati) don't realize that Microsoft was associated with the beginning of the modern movement for sovereign identity. Now, thanks to Daniel Buchner, Microsoft is using the Bitcoin blockchain in combination with the W3C DID specification, so that Bitcoin can be used for securing decentralized identifiers. Those identifiears are to be as widely useful and as interoperable as possible with every other platform in the world. That's the goal, anyways. Heavy stuff.

So I finally gathered together enough history, domain knowledge, that it's getting easier for me to understand Bitcoin, and it's complex web of relationships and codebases. At the same time, it's shown quite a bit of market dominance this year. So that made it even more urgent for me to focus *A Lot* more on Bitcoin specifically. 

So it was awesome when Vlad Costea asked me about writing for this book, since it was a perfect excuse to slot a few weeks in my schedule for focusing on Bitcoin, only. I wasn't sure if writing my story would be a worthwhile pursuit, however, I've come around by the end to see that I could write an educational piece about how I found Bitcoin, that's mostly not about me.

In preparation for this article, first, I organized all the information that I had saved about bitcoin. Previously it was in one or two folders all mixed up with content about other topics in crypto, not bitcoin related. Once I organized all of that stuff, I ended up with 4 different catalog systems, one for general, modern info, one for history, one for practical tools, libraries, and applications of bitcoin, including their guides, and one for Lightning Network only.

I'm going to share as much as I can manage of the Practical Bitcoin info, here. Plenty of people know *about* Bitcoin. However, very few are aware of the vast number of tools, applications, and connecting services, which can be used with Bitcoin. So hopefully, if the editor is thinking of cutting any of this article, I think the most useful is what follows:

## Practical Bitcoin

For this, I started with whatever I had come across over the past year, and saved. Then I went to lopp.net, bitcoin.org, and few of the other of the top Bitcoin resources, such as LNRoute. I've gone through those sites gathering a link at a time, to sort them all in an iterative process, figuring out categories as I go. Then I got into the Awesome lists, and really started feeling like I had surveyed a broad swath of the Bitcoin information ecosystem. That's when I dove face first into the Bitcoin Topic on Github. As far as finding practical applcations interacting with Bitcoin in some way, it's hard to find a more comprehensive source than this. I'm still not through the entire list.. and since my Bitcoin History repo only has 4 stars, I will have to sroll through to the very bottom where I'm sure some other gems are found. Not quite there, yet, but I said I'd have this draft on Wednesday.

>While managing your own keys ensures that you can't lose your money due to the negligence or maliciousness of a custodian, running a full node ensures that you can't be tricked into accepting invalid bitcoin payments. Running and using your own node gives you the strongest security model Bitcoin has to offer.
